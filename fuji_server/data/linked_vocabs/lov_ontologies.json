The focal point of the descriptive model is the bank - an entity that initiates different types of processes, whose common feature is that they are structured into various stages/events - and the relationship between the documentation produced and the information it contains. In fact, this ontology is based on information collected from archived documents which describe various processes and activities carried out by banking institutions: the starting point for its construction were the inventories and databases of documentation stored in the Historical Archive which was produced by the various banks that over time were merged into Intesa Sanpaolo. The ontology was created to provide a sufficiently abstract representation and model for describing the processes of various banking activities from which the documentation was produced - from a company's request for financing and its outcome, to the preparation of seizure, confiscation and asset restitution filings, to charitable contributions, just to mention a few examples - reusing models that were already well established and widely used. The structure of the proposed ontology is in fact intended to adapt to the various activities, described in the archive files that a banking institution performs in relation to third parties. The proposed ontology is therefore not an ontology on banking activity in general, but on the relationship between this activity and the documents that are produced. Moreover, its objective is not to describe the documents in the strict sense of the term, for which reference is made to OAD ontology. The purpose of this project is to lay the initial, and fundamental, building blocks for describing the complexity, variety, and breadth of the domain of archiving bank records and the data they contain. Despite having data from different banks relating to different activities and having already made arrangements for the integration of third-party datasets and ontologies, before completing the project we will have to wait for the processing of representations based on other types of documents and banking institutions, including non-Italian ones.", "subjects": ["other humanities"]}}, "lov.dbm": {"lov": {"id": "http://purl.org/net/dbm/ontology#", "uri_format": "http://purl.org/net/dbm/ontology#$1", "prefix": "dbm", "name": "DBM Ontology", "description": "An ontology for the Drug Bureau of Macedonia (DBM).", "subjects": ["health sciences"]}}, "lov.dbowl": {"lov": {"id": "http://ontology.cybershare.utep.edu/dbowl", "uri_format": "http://ontology.cybershare.utep.edu/dbowl/relational-to-ontology-mapping-primitive.owl#$1", "prefix": "dbowl", "name": "Relational to Ontology Mapping Primitive", "description": "Primitive ontology for database to Semantic Web mapping which subsumes classes that represent mappings to explicit OWL constructs, such as OWL class, object property, data property, etc. Classes in this ontology are populated by individuals representing components of the database schema being mapped.", "subjects": []}}, "lov.dbpedia-owl": {"lov": {"id": "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/", "uri_format": "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/$1", "prefix": "dbpedia-owl", "name": "The DBpedia Ontology", "description": "The DBpedia ontology provides the classes and properties used in the DBpedia data set.", "subjects": ["generic"]}}, "lov.dbug": {"lov": {"id": "http://ontologi.es/doap-bugs#", "uri_format": "http://ontologi.es/doap-bugs#$1", "prefix": "dbug", "name": "DOAP Bugs", "description": "An extension of DOAP for the description of bugs", "subjects": []}}, "lov.dcam": {"lov": {"id": "http://purl.org/dc/dcam/", "uri_format": "http://purl.org/dc/dcam/$1", "prefix": "dcam", "name": "DCMI Abstract Model", "description": "An abstract model for Dublin Core metadata", "subjects": ["generic"]}}, "lov.dcat": {"lov": {"id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat", "uri_format": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#$1", "prefix": "dcat", "name": "Data Catalog Vocabulary", "description": "DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web", "subjects": []}}, "lov.dce": {"lov": {"id": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/", "uri_format": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/$1", "prefix": "dce", "name": "Dublin Core Metadata Element Set", "description": "The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a vocabulary of fifteen properties for use in resource description.

First of all, we have employed little expressive means in an effort to retain computational properties for the resulting OWL ontology. Second, we have selected a subset of UFO-A [1, 2] and UFO-B [3] to include here. In particular, there is minimalistic support for UFO-B (only that which is necessary to establish the participation of objects in events and to capture historical dependence between events). Third, a lightweight ontology, differently from a reference ontology, is designed with the purpose of providing an implementation artifact to structure a knowledge base (or knowledge graph). This has driven a number of pragmatic implementation choices which are discussed in comments annotated to the various elements of this implementation. \n\nThe 'g' in gUFO stands for gentle.

SAREF4SYST defines Systems, Connections between systems, and Connection Points at which systems may be connected. These core concepts can be used generically to define the topology of features of interest, and can be specialized for multiple domains. The topology of features of interest is highly important in many use cases. If a room holds a lighting device, and if it is adjacent with an open window to a room whose luminosity is low, then by turning on the lighting device in the former room one may expect that the luminosity in the latter room will rise.\n\nThe SAREF4SYST ontology pattern can be instantiated for different domains. For example to describe zones inside a building (systems), that share a frontier (connections). Properties of systems are typically state variables (e.g. agent population, temperature), whereas properties of connections are typically flows (e.g. heat flow).\n\nSAREF4SYST has two main aims: on the one hand, to extend SAREF with the capability or representing general topology of systems and how they are connected or interact and, on the other hand, to exemplify how ontology patterns may help to ensure an homogeneous structure of the overall SAREF ontology and speed up the development of extensions.\n\nSAREF4SYST consists both of a core ontology, and guidelines to create ontologies following the SAREF4SYST ontology pattern. The core ontology is a lightweight OWL-DL ontology that defines 3 classes and 9 object properties.\n\nUse cases for ontology patterns are described extensively in  [ETSI TR 103 549 Clauses 4.2 and 4.3](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103549/01.01.01_60/tr_103549v010101p.pdf).\n\nFor the Smart Energy domain:\n\n- Electric power systems can exchange electricity with other electric power systems. The electric energy can flow both ways in some cases (from the Public Grid to a Prosumer), or in only one way (from the Public Grid to a Load). Electric power systems can be made up of different sub-systems. Generic sub-types of electric power systems include producers, consumers, storage systems, transmission systems. \n- Electric power systems may be connected one to another through electrical connection points. An Electric power system may have multiple connection points (Multiple Winding Transformer generally have one single primary winding with two or more secondary windings). Generic sub-types of electrical connection points include plugs, sockets, direct-current, single-phase, three-phase, connection points. \n- An Electrical connection may exist between two Electric power systems at two of their respective connection points. Generic sub-types of electrical connections include Single-phase Buses, Three-phase Buses. A single-phase electric power system can be connected using different configurations at a three-phase bus (RN, SN, TN types).\n\nFor the Smart Building domain:\n\n- Buildings, Storeys, Spaces, are different sub-types of Zones. Zones can contain sub-zones. Zones can be adjacent or intersect with other zones. \n- Two zones may share one or more connections. For example some fresh air may be created inside a storey if it has two controllable openings to the exterior at different cardinal points. \n\nA graphical overview of the SAREF4SYST ontology is provided in Figure 1. In such figure:\n\n- Rectangles are used to denote Classes. The label of the rectangle is the identifier of the Class.\n- Plain arrows are used to represent Object Properties between Classes. The label of the arrow is the identifier of the Object Property. The origin of the arrow is the domain Class of the property, and the target of the arrow is the range Class of the property.\n- Dashed arrows with identifiers between stereotype signs (i.e. \"`<< >>`\") refer to OWL axioms that are applied to some property.

Specifically, the model aims to clarify the identity and the relation of these visual signs, providing the necessary classes to characterise their constituent elements, reference, symbolic content and source of interpretation.\nVIR expands on key entities and properties from CIDOC-CRM, introducing new classes and relationships responding to the visual and art historical community, specifically building up on the iconographical tradition. The result is a model which differentiates between interpretation and element identified, providing a clear distinction between denotation and signification of an element. As a consequence of such distinction, the ontology allows for the definition of diverse denotative criteria for the same representation, which could change based on traditions and perspective.
